# express-nodejs
created basic servers for reading files,todo-apps and understanding express framework

you should install express for running this on your machine : 
-> npm install express

You can change the path or simply create a new directory 'files' with some text files in it 

You can install nodemon for automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
-> npm install nodemon
-> npx nodemon 'filename' (ensure that you are in the correct directory)

I have used Postman for testing: sending requests and receiving data
